# Day14

no idea the proper way to do part 2.  I guess and checked until I got it right.. basically the basis is that christmas tree would be safest and that in order to create a christmas tree there would have at least 8 adjacent robots.


```
part 1: 215987200 (75.70Âµs)
part 2: 8050 (68.67ms)
```

## algorithm

loop iterations and modulus vs remainder
